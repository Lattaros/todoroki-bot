# How do I install and use this source?

    npm install --save
    
Use this command in the bot source, this will cause you to install all the dependencies of the bot, and thus working normally( *casually some WARNs appear in the terminal, but rest assured, that means you are installing; now if there are likely to be several ERRs in a row, there is something wrong*).

Congratulations if you made it this far it means you learned how to install a Node.js dependency! Enough talk, let's go to the next step.

    node .

Using this command you will make it run the current folder, so it should always be at the root of the bot, so there are no errors.
