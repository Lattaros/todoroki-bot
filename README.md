*You can see my commands using the command, **t-commands***.
<hr>
If you are in the mood to use the source of my bot, feel free, I just ask you to read the LICENSE and do according to what is written in it, if you have any problems with the font, I'm sorry I won't be able to help you with that .

# How do I install and use this source?

**It is very simple and easy, with a few steps I will teach you how to do it.**

# How to download the repository?

First the repository must be downloaded on your machine, for this use the command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/Lattaros/todoroki-bot
The download from the terminal will start, and create a folder, in the same folder as the command was used.

<hr>
If you don't have Git CLI installed on your computer, you can download it from this button on the Github website itself.

Click on where it is shown and on, **Download ZIP**, a download will start, you just have to extract and you are ready for the next step.

# Configuring the folder
Okay, now go to index.js, and where it says ("token"), change it to your bot's token, like this: ("123"). If you still don't have your bot's token, you can get it by clicking [HERE](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).

# Installing the dependencies and starting the bot.

    npm install --save
    
Use this command in the bot source, this will cause you to install all the dependencies of the bot, and thus working normally( *casually some WARNs appear in the terminal, but rest assured, that means you are installing; now if there are likely to be several ERRs in a row, there is something wrong*).

**It must look like this.**

Congratulations if you made it this far it means you learned how to install a Node.js dependency! Enough talk, let's go to the next step.

    node .

Using this command you will make it run the current folder, so it should always be at the root of the bot, so there are no errors.

![If everything works.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669362719593332737/671108952682922035/unknown.png)

If everything is right, the return should look something like this.
