If you are in the mood to use the source of my bot, feel free, I just ask you to read the LICENSE and do according to what is written in it, if you have any problems with the font, I'm sorry I won't be able to help you with that .

# How do I install and use this source?

    npm intall --save
    
Use this command in the bot source, this will cause you to install all the dependencies of the bot, and thus working normally*( casually some WARNs appear in the terminal, but rest assured, that means you are installing; now if there are likely to be several ERRs in a row, there is something wrong)*
